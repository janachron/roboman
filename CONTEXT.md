Project: Web-based 2D game

Goal: Create a sharable browser game with graphics, animations, and sound that can be played without installing anything. The game should be lightweight, run smoothly in most browsers, and be easy to update and share via GitHub Pages.

Tech Stack:
- TypeScript for code structure and type safety
- Phaser.js for 2D game engine and rendering
- Vite for local dev server and bundling
- HTML/CSS for hosting and basic UI
- GitHub + GitHub Pages for version control and distribution

Scope:
- Core gameplay mechanics (player movement, obstacles, scoring)
- Visual assets: sprites, animations, and backgrounds
- Audio: simple music and sound effects
- Optional: start menu, pause, and restart functionality

Current State:
- Basic player movement (arrow keys + WASD) and a simple 2-frame walk animation.

Constraints:
- Must be free to develop and host
- Should run entirely in the browser (no installs)
- Lightweight for fast load times


Important:
- AI Agent must always remember to update PROGRESS.md before committing (remind me)
- AI Agent must always remember to updated CONTEXT.md if anything new has been learned (remind me)
