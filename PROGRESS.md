Progress Log

- Project scaffolding complete (Phaser + TypeScript + Vite, scripts, configs).
- GitHub Pages deployment set up and live at `https://janachron.github.io/roboman/`.
- Mobile-first layout with portrait canvas, overlay controls, and D-pad support.
- Start screen implemented; gameplay begins and music starts on button press.
- Core gameplay loop: player movement, enemy that seeks the player, bullets with auto-aim.
- Audio pipeline added (assets in `public/assets/audio/`, theme music plays on start).
- Enemy now has 20 HP; bullets deal 1 damage each.
- Added on-screen version label (`v0.1.7`) for deployment verification.
- Fire now only triggers from the Fire button on mobile (mouse left click on desktop).
- Enemy death now requires 20 hits and triggers a stronger hit effect.
- Adjusted canvas layout to better align with the viewport on mobile.
- Fixed desktop left-click firing and ensured enemy HP resets correctly.
- Added an on-screen enemy HP label to verify damage and updated click handling.
- Fixed desktop click firing and re-centered canvas on desktop.
- Fixed desktop click handler error and restored full-height canvas.
- Prevented start-button taps from firing on mobile; enforced mouse-only firing on desktop.
- Enemy visibility is now reinforced during updates to prevent disappearing.
- Added a desktop mousedown fallback for firing.
- Added document pointerdown fallback for desktop firing and enforced enemy visibility.
- Simplified desktop firing to mouse down with touch-guard.
- Added overscroll lock to reduce mobile zoom/pan issues.
- Disabled text selection on controls and tightened touch-action locking on mobile.
- Prevented touchmove on the game container to further stabilize mobile.
- Wired in the 4x4 Roboman sprite sheet (20x20 frames) with directional animations.
- Renamed sprite sheet file to remove spaces for reliable loading.
